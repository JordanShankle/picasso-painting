This is a project I did while first learning to code. I did it as part of the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum. 

In this project, I learned SVG icons, CSS positioning, & other basic CSS concepts I learned in previous projects.
    This project also helped give me a good understanding of how to use the different types of selectors, such as id & class selectors.
